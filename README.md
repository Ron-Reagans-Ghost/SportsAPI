MLBScraper
-----------

The file "mlbscraper.py" is the main file that makes use of a generic webscraper and generic CSV combinator to extract MLB player data from the Internet (as of right now, I use ESPN Stats). The data is stored within the "data" subdirectory. All of these operations are done in Python.

TODO: Pipe this scraped data into my work-in-progress Baseball Game Simulator, currently in Java.
