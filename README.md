MLBScraper
-----------

The file "mlbscraper.py" is the main file that makes use of a generic webscraper and generic CSV combinator to extract MLB player data from the Internet (as of right now, I use ESPN and CBS Stats). The data is stored within the "data" subdirectory. The scraper is becoming more and more versatile, where ideally it could scrape any conceivable HTML table on the web. All of these operations are done in Python.

Pipes the scraped data into my work-in-progress Baseball Game Simulator, currently in Java.
